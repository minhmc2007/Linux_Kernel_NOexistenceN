Linux kernel NOexistenceN
============

This project is a fork of the official Linux kernel from The Linux Foundation. It is intended as a "just for fun" project rather than a stable kernel for daily use. This kernel is being designed for a custom Linux From Scratch (LFS) project, titled "The NOexistenceN Of You And Me Linux," and includes modifications to kernel messages and a custom 'mood' system call.
